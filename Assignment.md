Design a collection with the following capabilities:
1. It should be able to store integer values.
2. The user should be able to specify how many elements the collection will store.
3. Each value in the collection should have a position (from 0 to max number of elements minus 1).
4. It should be possible to set the integer value of an element in a given position.
5. It should be possible to retrieve sum of elements from position a to position b.

So 3 APIs
1. Instantiate the collection
2. Set value at a given position
3. Get sum of values from position a to position b.
